Getting Started (RREF)
======================

This page details how to get started with photonic_circuit_solver. This page covers the RREF function and the photonic circuit solving algorithm.

This is entire codebase relies on the Stabilizer class, so if you haven't already read that page first (package installation is also covered there)
